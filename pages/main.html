            <h2 style="background-color: #1f1f31;">Introduction</h2>
            <p>Dan Heng's true Vidyahara form, revealed after accepting the residual powers from the previous reincarnation of "Imbibitor Lunae." Upon accepting the majestic horns atop his crown, he must accept all the merits and faults attributed to that person.</p>
            <p>However, he was never himself.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 style="background-color: #1f1f31;">Appearance</h2> 
            <p>Dan Heng • Imbibitor Lunae is a tall, slender young man with black hair, fair skin and green eyes with red eyeliner. As a Vidyadhara he has sharp ears, as well as green horns like those of a Chinese dragon. His attire is a white sleeveless shirt with a cutout on the chest, with long, unattached sleeves that have gold and green-colored accents. He wears black fingerless gloves and a green sash with a teal seal surrounded by golden leaves. His pants are black and his long knee-high boots have white and golden accents.</p>

                <li style="font-style: italic;">Unlocked at Character Level 20</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In the dim abyss devoid of light, he seemed to have returned to the insides of a Vidyadhara egg, being ceaselessly churned in tumultuous waves and elusive dreams.
            </p>
            <p>He dreamed he was standing before a sacrificial altar, dancing and chanting. However, the songs and gestures were mere facades. The light emanating from his eyes and the storm roiling in his blood were the true forces at play. Casually, he wove the misty and foggy tide in Scalegorge Waterscape, sealing the maddened and frenzied "dragon" into the propagating giant tree. As the echoing roar streamed up into the heavens and dissipated, Scalegorge Waterscape will continue its peace for centuries more, and his duty was over.
            </p>
            <p>The ceremony ended, and he turned to look behind him. In the blink of an eye, the stairs he had stepped down from had become full of standing dignitaries with draconic horns and dressed like royalty. As if they were mirages in a mirror, each of them turned and their sleeves swirled with the motion, ready to leave one after another in a meticulously calculated arrangement. Innumerable, they formed a staircase to the sky, stretching into the never-ending spatial void. The faces of all these people would greet him every morning in his dressing mirror — That was his face.
            </p>
            <p>No, it was the face of the primordial, the original, the very first high elder. He smiled bitterly and covered his face with his palm, as if ascertaining whether he could tear off this mask and return it to its true owner.
            </p>
            <p>He could not.
